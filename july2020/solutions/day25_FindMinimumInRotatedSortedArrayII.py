# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

# (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

# Find the minimum element.

# The array may contain duplicates.

# Example 1:
# Input: [1,3,5]
# Output: 1

# Example 2:
# Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
# Output: 0
